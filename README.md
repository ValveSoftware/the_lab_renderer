# The Lab Renderer

Valve’s VR renderer used in The Lab (Valve’s VR launch title for the HTC Vive). 

This is the set of scripts and shaders that drove rendering in The Lab. It is a forward renderer with support for up to 18 dynamic shadowing lights in a single pass with MSAA enabled, and it included the Adaptive Quality system that dynamically adjusts rendering resolution to maintain framerate in VR. 

Requires Unity 5.4.b15 or newer.
